	<p>I had a good school year this year. I enjoyed a lot of my classes, particularly honors chemistry because I was able to challenge myself and learn new concepts. This was the first year that I had AP tests which mad it a different from my classes last year but I enjoyed having more challenging classes and also having a wider range of courses to select at the begining of the year. Overall it was a good year and I hope that next year goes smoothly, im looking forward to it.</p>
